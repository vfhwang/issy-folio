For my third workshop with the local old age pensioners in my home village in Yorkshire, I took a picture of the local landscape and then each person a was given a different section of the image to work on in a medium of their choice. At the end when we pieced the images together they were able to see how each of the images they worked on created the complete landscape. When the group saw the end result as a whole they were very pleased and proud of their work which was rewarding.
