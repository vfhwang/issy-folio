To run alongside the Beazley Designs Of the Year exhibition I designed a workshop where families could make their own puppet inspired by Walter Van Beirendonck’s puppet costumes for ‘The Magic Flute’.

For February half term I designed a workshop where families could collaborate and create a life size Martian garden and design space food packaging influenced by the Moving to Mars exhibition.
