To run alongside the Moving to Mars exhibition I designed a workshop where families could make their own rockets, space jackets and miniature space ship to take you to Mars.

 For November and December I designed a workshop where families could make their own decorations and wrapping paper to paint, print and stitch your way into the festive winter holidays.
