To run alongside the Moving to Mars exhibition I designed a workshop where families could make their own rockets, space jackets and miniature space ship to take you to Mars. To see more Information on the Design Museum website click [here](https://designmuseum.org/whats-on/families/create-and-make-past/autumn-sunday-create-and-make-crafting-a-mission-to-mars).

For the October half term, I designed a collaborative workshop where families could help create a life size spaceship model to take you to Mars! Using recycled cardboard they could build the control panels to help steer the ship and places to eat, sleep, relax and work.

For winter season I designed a workshop where families could make their own decorations and wrapping paper to paint, print and stitch your way into the festive winter holidays.
