During the 2 weeks work experience at the National Theatre I was given the opportunity to improve skills in mould making. I was taught how to work with a variety of techniques and materials, and where to apply each method in future work.

Then in September I was brought back for 4 weeks as a prop maker working on the build for St George and the Dragon. I was responsible ageing objects to make them look rusty or dirty and modifying props. This was my first experience of working for a theatrical production for the entire duration. I found it really rewarding and enjoyable to be a part of all stages of the prop making.
