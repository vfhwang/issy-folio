Following my two weeks work experience, I was brought back in to assist with mould making for the Jimney cricket puppet used in the production of Pinocchio. We made 2 of the puppets. This involved large amounts of repeat moulding, along with ensuring that these moulds were durable for use in a long running production. After finishing the build of Jimney I then assisted with brown papering, scrimming and making facial hair such as eyebrows and moustaches.
