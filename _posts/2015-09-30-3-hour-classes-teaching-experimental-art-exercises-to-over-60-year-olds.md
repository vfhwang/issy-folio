For my first workshop with the local old age pensioners in my home village in Yorkshire I set up stations with different drawing materials and then made a rotation so that everyone was able to  draw each other using all the different materials I laid out. It was really interesting seeing how people used the materials in different ways. At the end we placed all the portraits on the wall so everyone could see them which and then discussed which particular portraits people liked and why which was enjoyable.
