For 1 week in lockdown I worked with the Visual communicators on a project that I've previously designed with the Tutors at Kingston called ‘You’ve Been Framed’. 

Unlike other years we've ran this project the groups had the added differently of working as a group but from their bedrooms. It was very inspiring to see how they creatively managed to still make it work.
