Over this Summer 2018 I worked on the production of Eyam and Emilia, both new writings. My job was to make the miniature houses that replicated the existing buildings in Eyam. For Emilia I assisted in making 1,500 fake books. Then again for Dr Faustus in the winter season, I assisted in making a further 500 fake books.
