Over the summer of 2017 I worked for Chocolate Films as a workshop facilitator on at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. We were running an animation workshop as part of the Insect Adventure Camp. People of all ages and abilities were invited to join us to break the world record for the number of people contributing to an animated film. Each day we made a frame of our animation using 2D cut outs and then animated the frame we made the day before. The animation is a story of pollination focusing on an oil beetles life. During this project 2753 people aged 2- 60 visited over 47 days.
