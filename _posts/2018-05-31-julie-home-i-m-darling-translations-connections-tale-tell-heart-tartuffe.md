As a casual freelance prop maker at the National theatre in 2018 I worked on the build for the following productions : Exit the King, Julie, Translations, Home I’m Darling, Connections 2018, Pericles, Tale Tell Heart and Tartuffe. On these different productions I furthered my skills in areas such as upholstery, mould making and scenic paint effects. Here's a few examples of this.
