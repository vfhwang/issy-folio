Over the course of a week I worked with the Visual communicators on a project we called ‘You’ve Been Framed’. The students make a set and produce a photograph from relating to a painting we picked from Tate Britain. Designed as a group project, we wanted to show them how important it is to work together and learn about the different roles in the process of building the set to presenting the final image.
